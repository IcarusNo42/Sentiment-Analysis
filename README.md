# Sentiment-Analysis
For my sentiment analysis project, I performed an analysis on a dataset of user reviews from Amazon, using machine learning techniques. The goal of this project was to classify the sentiment of each review as positive or negative, based on the text of the review.

To find the most effective machine learning model for this task, I experimented with 8 different models, including Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). I evaluated the performance of each model on a held-out test set and selected the best-performing model for deployment.

This project was completed as one of the final projects for the Advanced Programming course during the Spring 2023 semester at the Iran University of Science and Technology. I followed a similar architecture to that provided in the project description but tailored it to fit my specific dataset and needs. This involved preprocessing the data, training the different machine learning models, evaluating their performance, and deploying the best-performing model to make predictions on new reviews.
